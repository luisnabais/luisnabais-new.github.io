### Personal Life
I love technology, knowledge sharing (I think that's the origin of my taste in Open Source since teenager), sports and travelling.

I'm a big fan of a healty lifestyle and I practice sports daily, mostly running and calisthenics (strength/resistance bodyweight exercises).
A great part of my motivation and leadership skills, which I use daily, come from what I learn from sports, mainly when running.

### What do I do?

I work as an IT DevOps Engineer and Change Manager. That means I need to make sure the IT processes are correctly integrated and automated, through CI/CD practices and Open Source tools and languages.

I have 15+ years of experience with Open Source, which allowed me to gain knowledge in multiple areas inside the IT world.
I'm a Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE), since 2010.
I have knowledge about Linux, Docker (including Docker Swarm), Kubernetes, Ansible, GitLab, GitHub, Jenkins, Git, Shell Scripting, Python and databases (MariaDB/MySQL, PostgreSQL), among other technologies.
More details on my CV can be checked on my LinkedIn profile.

### Mindset
I have a very practical and positive mindset, directed to growth. I work easily in/with teams and have leadership skills. I'm joyful, very motivated and determined.
I'm fascinated about human potential and seeing motivated people, setting and beating higher goals.

It's amazing to see someone beating their goals, which earlier seemed impossible, like running long distances or with a faster pace.
I apply the same principles daily, constantly trying to grow, be a better version of myself. I constantly explore new technologies, read books, blogs and articles on many subjects, whether are from my known areas or not, to get out of my confort zone and open new doors.
I'm very motivated and positive and I love to expand it to other people.

Some fun facts about me:
* My first computer was a ZX Spectrum 48K (thank you, dad, for presenting it to me while I was so young), where I met the world of programming, for the first time.
* I've ran many (I lost count, but should be about 20-30) half-marathons (21.097 km) and two full marathons (42.195 km).
* I truly believe that people can do anything they set their minds into, if they really desire it and fight for it.
